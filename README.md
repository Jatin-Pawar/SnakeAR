# SnakeAR


This project contains the implementation of "Introduction to ARCore in Unity" Codelab.

Note:

      * This is based on arcore-unity-sdk-v1.4.1.unitypackage.
      * You can reimport arcore-unity-sdk-v1.4.1.unitypackage to double check if anything is missing.
      * Make sure your device has ARCore installed on it(Link to ARCore Appp: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_IN)

Build Setting:

              * Check out the build setting for any ARCore project.
              * Checkout "Configure build settings" section in the given link.
              https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android

This works right out of the box. Clone the repo and build an make an apk and try it out on your ARCore supported Device.
